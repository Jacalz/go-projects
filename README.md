# go-projects
A repository housing small Go projects that are too small for their own repository. The size, complexity and usefulness of the projects varies a lot. It contains a mix of various small code snippets written while I was learning Go, during math classes or other random stuff. There is no guarantee of stability. Use at your own risk.
